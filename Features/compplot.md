# CompPlot

Visualize all copy number variant calls within a study

CompPlot visualizes all deletions (shown in a darker shade) and duplications (lighter shade) within a particular region of the genome for an entire study population at once. If we see lots of events overlapping a particular gene in individuals with a particular disease (red colors) and relatively few in healthy individuals (green color), then that gene is likely a cause of the disease.

![Here we can see all deletions (fewer copies of a genetic region than expected; darker version of a color) and duplications (more copies of a genetic region than expected; lighter version of a color) within a particular region of the genome for an entire study population at once. If we see lots of events overlapping a particular gene in individuals with a particular disease (red colors) and relatively few in healthy individuals (green color), then that gene (PRKN in this case) is a likely cause of the disease (e.g., Parkinson disease).](/images/CompPlot_Image1.png)
![Instead of color-coding by case-control status, you can also use this tool to compare and contrast CNV calls (or mosaic calls or runs of homozygosity) that were generated by different calling algorithms.](/images/CompPlot_Image2.png)
![Which calls are displayed can be filtered based on the number of probes (array data) or bins (sequencing data) that overlap each call, the size in kb, or a quality metric.](/images/CompPlot_Image3.png)
