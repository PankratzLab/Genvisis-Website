# Genvisis Workflow  

Automated pipeline for processing data

Genvisis can perform dozens of data processing steps to turn raw array and sequencing data into analyzable data using best practices. After selecting your analysis goals (e.g,. sample quality control, copy number variant calls, imputation-ready VCFs), the Workflow customizes which steps are needed to produce the best version of the desired data.
