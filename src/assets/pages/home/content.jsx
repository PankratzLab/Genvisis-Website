      "Genvisis is a robust software package that takes advantage of unique compressed data structures to efficiently process, assess quality of, analyze, and visualize the intensity data from GWAS arrays. \n\n Specialized algorithms are used to call CNVs, and each algorithm uses its own approach. Genvisis allows a CNV to be inspected by visualizing boundaries overlaid with probe intensities.",

      "Genvisis is an open-source, end-to-end solution for processing raw array data and deep resequencing data into variant calls, especially copy number variant calls. It also introduces novel methodology to optimize accuracy by directly addressing the effects of DNA quality, DNA quantity, and batch/plate/flow cell in the data normalization.",
