[Marcotte et al.](https://doi.org/10.1002/gcc.22457) used Genvisis to create this forest plot for a variant near SPRY4 that had been previously linked to adult testicular cancer and demonstrated that the association was not only generalizable to pediatric testicular cancer but also to other germ cell tumors cancers. Here we see that the association is even stronger for ovarian cancer than testicular cancer (though the confidence intervals are large and overlapping).
