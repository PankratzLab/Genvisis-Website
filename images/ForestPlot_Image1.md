The CHARGE Consortium Hematology Working Group used Genvisis to make [this forest plot](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3607) for a variant in S1PR4 that displays the relative effect sizes for each cohort in the discovery and replication sets. The area of each square is proportional to the study's size and therefore influence in the inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis. We can see that most studies individually did not have the statistical power to reach significance (the confidence interval overlaps the vertical line representing no effect); however, all but two studies showed a consistent direction of effect and the meta-analysis reached genome-wide significance.
